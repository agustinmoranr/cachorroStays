# cachorroStays

This is the repo for the team, The Callback Boys' Platzi Escuela de JS project.

This is the staging branch, where we will save all of our progress instead of saving everything to the master branch.

# hotels_details_pg

This branch is meant for the basic skeleton for the hotels details pg.

Once the user selects a dog hotel to view further, they will arrive to this structure of a page.
